# Pupil Research 

Try to extract attention signal from pupillary waveforms under natural conditions. Eye contact implies attention, but how does pupil dilation tell us about brain states ?

### Experiment videos 

 - *Experiment Videos to Test Emotional Arousal and Scene Understanding of Infants*

      Videos contains variations of center-surround brightness, and bright spot in motion, in order to ellicit pippilary reflex under various illumination conditions. 

### Data Preprocessing

 - *Data Visualization Tools for Eye Tracking Devices*

     Superimpose pupil size and location on video clips. 

 - *Singal Filter*

     BandPass filter and removes eye blinks. Decovolution signal with Erlang Gamma Kernal. 
   
 - *Video2Saliency*
  
     Extract saliency value at gaze point.


### Data Manifold Analysis in Saliency Feature Space

 - Codes that performs dimensionality reduction utilizing Scikit Learn machine learning library.


### Feature Learning

 - *Pupil-RNN*

   LSTM model to predict gender from sequence of pupil size.   

### Semi-supervised Classification

 - *Local Outlier Factor*

   Unsupervised Novelty/Anamaly Detection for rare disorder 

 - *SVM with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC-SVM)*

   Robust classifier with limited soft labels
 
### RNN for Disoder Prediction

 - Attention based LSTM model to predict visual attention
